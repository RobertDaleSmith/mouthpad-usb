# MouthPad^ USB – nRF Firmware (Zephyr)

Zephyr application that runs on Nordic nRF52840 boards (tested primarily on the Seeed XIAO nRF52840)
and turns a MouthPad^ wearable into a wired USB HID device without touching the MouthPad^ firmware.

## Supported hardware

| Board | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Seeed XIAO nRF52840 (`xiao_ble`) | ✅ Production | Primary shipping target. Button + single-colour LED. |
| Adafruit Feather nRF52840 (`adafruit_feather_nrf52840`) | ✅ Production | Requires custom bootloader config. |
| Nordic nRF52840 Dongle (`nrf52840dongle`) | ✅ Production | PCA10059 with stock Nordic LED pins. |
| April Brothers nRF52840 Dongle (`nrf52840dongle`) | ✅ Production | PCA10059 with non-standard LED wiring. |

The default overlays assume a single status LED and a user button. Dongle variants use different overlays
for Nordic (stock pins) vs April Brothers (non-standard LED wiring).

## Features

* Bridges BLE HID and Nordic UART Service (NUS) traffic to USB HID + dual CDC ACM.
* Mirrors LED behaviour from the ESP32 build: slow blink while scanning, solid when connected, short
  pulses on activity.
* Maintains a maintenance console on the second CDC port with `dfu`, `reset`, and `serial` commands.
* Uses TinyUSB for USB descriptors, matching those exposed by the ESP32 firmware.
* Supports UF2 updates (drag-and-drop or via the `dfu` command).

## Build & flash

You can build the Zephyr firmware inside the provided Docker image or in your own Zephyr/NCS workspace.

### Option 1 – Docker (no local toolchain)

```bash
cd ncs  # Navigate to NCS workspace directory

# Build the XIAO nRF52840 target and drop UF2 artefacts in build/
docker-compose run --rm mouthpad-build

# Start an interactive shell with the Zephyr toolchains mounted
docker-compose run --rm mouthpad-dev
```

The automated build copies `zephyr.uf2` to `build/mouthpad_usb_xiao_ble_<date>.uf2` so you can drag it
directly to the bootloader volume.

### Option 2 – Local workspace (`west`/`make`)

Prerequisites:

* nRF Connect SDK / Zephyr toolchain installed locally.
* `west` on your `PATH` and environment variables (`ZEPHYR_BASE`, `ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR`, …) set.

Workflow:

```bash
# First time only (initialises NCS workspace)
make init

# Build for the default board (xiao_ble)
make build

# Flash via J-Link
make flash

# Copy the UF2 to a mounted bootloader drive
make flash-uf2

# Open an RTT console (requires Segger tools, see Makefile for paths)
make monitor
```

Override the board with `BOARD=<board>` when calling `make build`.

## Firmware layout & DFU

* **UF2 updates:** double-tap reset to mount the bootloader drive (`XIAO-SENSE` on macOS/Linux), then
  copy `build/app/zephyr/zephyr.uf2`. You can also type `dfu` on the maintenance CDC port to reboot into
  the bootloader without touching the board.
* **CDC console commands:** available on `/dev/cu.usbmodem<serial>3` (macOS) / `/dev/ttyACM1` (Linux).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dfu`   | Reboot into the UF2 bootloader. |
| `clear` | Disconnect and clear all BLE bonds, then return to pairing mode. |
| `serial` | Print the USB serial number used in the `usbmodem` node name. |

## LED behaviour

GPIO LEDs use discrete colours; NeoPixels (if present) use gradients. States:

| State | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `LED_STATE_SCANNING` | Slow blink while seeking the MouthPad^. |
| `LED_STATE_CONNECTED` | Solid on. |
| `LED_STATE_DATA_ACTIVITY` | Fast flicker when forwarding HID traffic. |
