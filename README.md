## üéØ Features

- **BLE Central**: Connects to BLE HID devices (mice, keyboards, etc.)
- **USB HID Device**: Emulates the same HID device over USB
- **BLE UART**: Forwards additional data over USB CDC serial
- **MCUboot DFU**: Full over-the-air firmware update support
- **UF2 Support**: Easy firmware updates via UF2 bootloader

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- **Seeed XIAO nRF52840** board
- USB cable for programming and USB HID functionality
- BLE HID device to bridge (e.g., wireless mouse, keyboard)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Build the Project

This project includes a convenient Makefile that wraps `west` commands for easy building, flashing, and monitoring.

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Build the project
make build

# Build for a specific board
make BOARD=xiao_ble build
make BOARD=nrf52840dongle build
```

### 2. Available Make Commands

```bash
# Core commands
make build              # Build the project
make flash              # Flash to device
make monitor-nordic     # Open serial monitor (Nordic boards)
make clean              # Clean build directory

# Convenience commands
make build-flash        # Build and flash in one command
make build-flash-monitor # Build, flash, and monitor
make pristine           # Clean and rebuild from scratch

# Configuration
make menuconfig         # Open configuration menu
make config             # Show build configuration
```

### 3. Flash the Device

```bash
# Flash to device
make flash

# Build and flash in one command
make build-flash

# Build, flash, and monitor in one command
make build-flash-monitor
```

### 4. Monitor Output

```bash
# Monitor serial output for debugging
make monitor-nordic
```

## üîß DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade)

This project includes full DFU support with two methods:

### Method 1: MCUboot DFU (Over-the-Air)

1. **Initial Setup**: Flash the device with `make flash` (includes MCUboot bootloader)
2. **Enter DFU Mode**: 
   - Connect via serial: `make monitor`
   - Type `dfu` in the shell
   - Device reboots into bootloader mode
3. **Update Firmware**: Run `make flash` again

### Method 2: UF2 Bootloader

1. **Enter UF2 Mode**: Double-tap the reset button
2. **Copy Firmware**: Copy `build/zephyr/app.uf2` to the `XIAO-SENSE` volume
3. **Automatic Restart**: Device restarts with new firmware

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Flash Partitions (MCUboot)

The device uses the following flash layout:
- **0x00000-0x0FFFF**: MCUboot bootloader (64KB)
- **0x10000-0x4FFFF**: Application slot 0 (256KB)
- **0x50000-0x8FFFF**: Application slot 1 (256KB)
- **0x90000-0x9FFFF**: Scratch area (64KB)
- **0xA0000-0xFFFFF**: Storage (384KB)

### Key Configuration Options

- `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y`: Enable MCUboot bootloader
- `CONFIG_USB_DFU_CLASS=y`: Enable USB DFU support
- `CONFIG_BUILD_OUTPUT_UF2=y`: Generate UF2 files
- `CONFIG_BT_CENTRAL=y`: Enable BLE central mode
- `CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL=y`: Enable BLE peripheral mode

## üîç Troubleshooting

### DFU Issues

**Problem**: Device reboots but doesn't enter DFU mode
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure MCUboot is properly flashed: `make flash`
2. Check that the device tree overlay is correct
3. Verify flash partitions are properly configured

**Problem**: UF2 volume doesn't appear
**Solution**:
1. Double-tap the reset button quickly
2. Or hold reset while plugging in USB cable
3. Check that `CONFIG_BUILD_OUTPUT_UF2=y` is set

### Build Issues

**Problem**: Build fails with MCUboot errors
**Solution**:
1. Clean build: `make clean`
2. Rebuild: `make build`
3. Check that all required configurations are set in `prj.conf`

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: BLE device not connecting
**Solution**:
1. Check device is in range and advertising
2. Verify device has HID service
3. Monitor serial output: `make monitor`

## üìö Available Commands

```bash
make build      # Build with MCUboot bootloader
make clean      # Clean build directory
make flash      # Flash via west (requires bootloader mode)
make flash-uf2  # Get UF2 flashing instructions
make monitor    # Monitor serial output
make dfu        # Trigger DFU mode via serial
make help       # Show all available commands
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**: Edit source files in `src/`
2. **Build**: `make build`
3. **Test**: `make monitor` to see output
4. **Flash**: `make flash` or use UF2 method
5. **Iterate**: Repeat as needed
